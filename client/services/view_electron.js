/// View is performing several roles:
///
/// + It "pretends" to be a rust/wasm service that is only accessible over a socket or message channel - ie: an asynchronous arms length relationship.
///
/// + It receives commands or requests with a 'fragment' of a scene graph - this will be painted or updated persistently to a display. This is the key role.
///
/// + The design intent is that important events such as mouse movement or touch events can be piped back to a caller if they specify an event return channel.
///
/// + If this is written well, it should be swappable for a native rust/wasm or other rasterizer and event handler.
///
/// + Right now it is a singleton; this is subject to revision
///
///	+ I render to electron for fun and profit - basically it pretends to be a feature rich rasterization layer

/*

handle view related events only

- events could be piped up to flo
	to accomplish that then flo would have to understand the view grammar, which seems wrong
	so i think as a compromise it is best if the view layer understands the scripting and handles stuff

- events could be handled here
	it does mean losing some generality, now events are not really chewed up by flo
	at the same time, it does mean that flo doesn't need to be as smart arguably

- a third approach would be to register channel handlers, but then somebody has to handle it - a new flo thread?
