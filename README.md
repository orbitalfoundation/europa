# Orbital SDL

## Areas of Focus

This code defines an SDL (scenario definition language) for defining apps made of parts. There is an 'sdl evaluation engine' that is used to exercise the SDL. The focus is on formalizing the SDL itself to see if it can cover a space of expressing real world every day applications.
